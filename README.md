# Flight-Reservation-System-using-Python
Flight Reservation System is a Python OOP project simulating airline booking. Passengers can sign in, check flights, and book tickets, while the cashier can add flights, approve bookings, and issue tickets. Available tickets update automatically, and the system handles multiple flights and passengers efficiently.
